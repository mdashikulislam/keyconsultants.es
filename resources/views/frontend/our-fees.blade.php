									This will involve the use of an engineer and surveyor who will need to draw up full
									plans regarding the electricity, disabled access and toilets and emergency lighting.
									Once the works have been completed, the license transferred in your name, can you
									then use the license to contact utilities such as electricity and water. Then you
									will need to register the business with the <i>conselleria de turismo</i>. (tourism
									council). Once all of the licenses are in place, you can then register yourself or
									your business with the tax office and the social security department.
